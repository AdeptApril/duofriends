## Reason for failure

While developing this, API calls to Duolingo began returning 401 Unauthorized, thus it was impossible to get additional data from the API calls.

There might be ways around it, or work again after some period of time, but for now it's a hard stop to program development.

## Idea for the program

Since opting out of leagues requires one to also opt out of leaderboards, it'd be nice to still have a personal leaderboard. It'd also be nice to be able to compare things like streak length, lingots, xp by language, and levels or other by-language accomplishments.

## Other issues

The available JSON doesn't seem to easily show total points, or to see crown levels at all. Doubtless, there are ways around all of these issues -- e.g., scraping web content -- but it wasn't in the scope of what I imagined when starting the project. And I also didn't want to use the site in such a way that might violate terms of service.
